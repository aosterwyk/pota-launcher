POTA Launcher is a script that selects a WSJT-X config and optionally launches a few additional apps. The idea is to have one shortcut to launch everything.

The script and repo owner are not associated with the POTA program. 

## Installation

Download the script or clone the repo (recommended). The script uses git to check for updates if you clone the repo. 

## Usage

- TODO - app launch options
- TODO - app install dirs

## Support
